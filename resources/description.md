# Contributor's Workshop

At the heart of open source are developers like you: people of all backgrounds, interests, and experience levels. In this 3-hour workshop, you'll learn how to contribute to Ember, meet the other developers who shape our favorite framework, and if you're up for the challenge, make a pull request!

The workshop will begin with some formal instruction. Where do you start? What goes into a good PR? Who will help? What knowledge or skills do you need before you jump in? (Spoiler alertâ€”not a whole lot! Learning new things is part of the fun.)

The rest will be guided coding time. You'll have the opportunity to pair program or fly solo as you tackle an issue in Ember's learning resources or core code. Available issues will cover a wide range, appropriate for beginners and experts alike. A group of experienced contributors will be there to help debug, advise, and answer questions.

The workshop will include some formal instruction, guidance from a team of experienced contributors, and hands-on coding time. Attendees should bring a laptop, budget an hour of setup time in the week before the workshop, and watch for emailed instructions about setup.
