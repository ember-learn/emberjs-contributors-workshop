# Expectations

This document outlines what is expected from the different roles involved in running the workshop, in terms of time and tasks.

## Hosts

1. Arranging mentors (5h)

You are responsible for arranging enough mentors to help contributors during the workshop.
While a ratio of 1 mentor to 1 contributor is unrealistic, we recommend to strive for at least 1 mentor to 5 every contributors.

1. Preparing the introduction material (1h)

Once you have hosts and mentors defined you should update the introductory slides to include that information.

1. Running the workshop (5h)

On the day of the actual workshop you should outline the workshop format and introduce the different mentors.
Then try to keep an eye on people having a hard time participating or finding work to do and try to help out.
We recommend a 3h format as well as leaving yourself some prep and wind down time.

1. Workshop follow-up (1h)

## Mentors

1. Prepate issues for the workshop (3h) [BONUS]

If you can prepare a handful of issues for the contributors to pick up, that is very helpful for everyone.
Make sure the instructions in the issues are clear and actionable, and that it can reasonably be finished during the workshop.

1. Workshop (5h)

Come early. Help contributors pick issues and guide them through the process of contributing.
