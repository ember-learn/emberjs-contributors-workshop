## EmberConf Contributors Workshop Volunteer Guide

Thanks for volunteering! This workshop is only possible with community support. Here’s everything you need to know, including times, locations, and facilitator contact info. All volunteers are expected to follow [Ember’s Code of Conduct](https://www.emberjs.com/guidelines/).

**Optional pre-workshop gathering**: If you can, please join us on Sunday, March 10th. Time and location are provided by email. We’ll talk through any final questions, curate some more issues, and then maybe go get real Portland food somewhere. If you're arriving later in the evening, updates will be posted in the #conf-workshop channel on Slack.

**When to arrive**:  Arrive at 8:30am. We’ll go over any final details and provide some breakfast food/coffee. The workshop starts at 9am, so we expect attendees will begin arriving around 8:30.

**Who to contact if you have questions, get lost, etc**: @locks and @jenweber via Slack. Jen's cell is provided via email.

**What to bring**:  Your laptop and charger. If you have a spare laptop, bring that too. If someone can’t get their dev env set up, we’d love to have some loaner computers.

### How to prepare: 
Please set aside an hour or so to prepare. For each repository you’re familiar with, make sure you have an up to date copy that is able to be run locally. If you are willing to share your laptop as a loaner for attendees who can’t get their dev env set up, we recommend setting up a guest profile on your OS. Make sure that the guest can’t accidentally use your git credentials. Many of us have admin privileges and are one command away from pushing to master.

Additionally, the Emberjs.com website app runs in a ruby dev environment, so you can either set up ruby/middleman or follow the instructions to use Docker. Please try to set it up on your own computer so you can help others with it. The Docker method is strongly recommended. It will not work on Windows.

### Your role during the workshop:
Most volunteers will be seated at a table that holds about 10 people. Your goals are to help contributors choose issues, answer questions, assist with dev env setup, and most of all, be supportive and encouraging! We are hoping that some of these attendees will be inspired to keep helping out with Ember. We are all where we are today because someone else helped us out, or they were kind and welcoming. Do your best to involve everyone at your table - ask people what they are working on, what they are interested in, why they want to get involved, etc. Keep in mind that many people may silently struggle, so be sure to ask each person what questions they have or if they need any help.

### Workshop Structure
In the first hour, Ricardo and Jen will lead a short activity, a presentation on what makes Ember tick (RFCs, quest issues, general contributor how-to), and guide attendees through selecting an Issue to work on. Attendees will be encouraged to pair up and choose small issues. The next 2 hours will be open workshop time. In the final 15 mins, we will do a wrap up and ask attendees to share their contact info if they want to keep working on Ember issues.

### Thank you! We're excited you're joining us :)
